# SHOPSPREENG- NEARBY

This is an example project using the google-nearby api to communicate with devices within a 30m (100ft) range

## HOW TO USE SETUP

* Clone project or download project
* Open project in android studio
* Connect device and run application

## HOW TO USE
Install on two devices, click advertise on one device and click discovery on the other.

A pairing dialog shows up on both devices, accept connection on both devices.

Type a message inside the input field and click publish.

On publish, the message delivers to the other device and vice versa.

**IMPORTANT:** 

_**INTERNET** connection is required for delivering published messages_

## ISSUES :exclamation:

Contrary to the impression given that Nearby works without internet, unfortunately is not so.

- published messages require internet connection to deliver as the application communicates with the cloud console to verify published messages. :sweat_drops:
- connection between devices however do not require internet connection
